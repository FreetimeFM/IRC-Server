# IRC Server

A super simple IRC server created in the span of four weeks for an assignment. Created by me, [Jordan Keiller](https://github.com/jordankeiller), [Mikolaj Olejnik](https://github.com/MikolajOlejnik).

Server.py contain the executable for Bot and Server respectively. They take in NO parameters. To change the address/port in the server.py navigate to lines 61 and 62
and change the entries.
